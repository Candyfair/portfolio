          <p>My parents bring home an Amstrad CPC 464. It has a tape drive and a green monochrome monitor. Games are all pixelized and can take up to 15 minutes to load. I'm 7 and I'm hooked.</p>

          <p>I'm at secondary school, I chose an IT option and I'm learning how to code in Turbo Pascal. So vintage!</p>

          <p>At home, we now have a computer that reads 5Â¼" floppy disks, and a dot-matrix printer. My mom teaches me how to use MS Office suite and I start writing my first novel. After 150 pages and a hard drive crash, I lose everything I wrote. That's how I learn the importance of doing backups and saving my work regularly.</p>

          <p>As a student, I have a part-time job as a night receptionist. With few visitors and a laptop left for the reception, I use this machine to make my first website on GeoCities with lots of frames, blinking titles and very aggressive animated gifs.</p>

          <p>I move to the South of France and start an online business. I begin with the open source platform Joomla and the extension Virtuemart for e-commerce. Two years later my business expands and I migrate to Prestashop. For both of these I learn to use PHP to make my site stand out.</p>
